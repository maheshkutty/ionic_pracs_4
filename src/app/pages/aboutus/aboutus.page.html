      The institute is located in 47 acres of green campus at Andheri (W), the
      fastest growing suburb of Mumbai. The campus also houses four Bhavan’s

      and science college), Sardar Patel College of Engineering – Government
      aided Engineering college, S.P. Jain Institute of Management and Research,
      a management institute and A.H. Wadia, higher secondary school. <br/><br/> In 1957,
      the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan conceived the idea of establishing an
      engineering college in Mumbai. Sardar Patel College of Engineering was
      inaugurated on 19th August 1962. <br/><br/> In 1995 self-financed engineering courses
      were added to it and it functioned as Sardar Patel College of Engineering
      (Unaided-wing) conducting Electronics Engineering, Computer Engineering
      and Information Technology Courses and Masters course in Electronics since
      2005 till 2008. These courses have earned a great reputation in the field
      of engineering education, as well as industry. Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan’s
      Sardar Patel College of Engineering, Unaided Wing was established in its
      new building under the name and style of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan’s Sardar
      Patel Institute of Technology since 2005 and is affiliated to Mumbai
